# [Project 2: Earnings by Telecommute Stateus: Project Overview](https://rpubs.com/dickeyt/telecommute)
For this example project I built a linear regression model to estimate weekly earnings by telecommute status, age,  and by hours worked. This could be useful for someone who is looking to maximize or minimize wages paid.

I was able to get the model to predict average weekly earnings at a 95% confidence level after minimal tuning and transformations.
